# Connect 4 with Minimax AI (LÖVE2D + Lua)

A classic **Connect 4** game built in **Lua using the LÖVE2D framework**, featuring:

* A playable 2D board
* Player vs AI mode
* AI powered by **Minimax algorithm** with **Alpha-Beta pruning**

> 🎮 Built as a group project by 3 team members.

---

## 🎯 Features

* Interactive and aesthetic GUI (LÖVE2D)
* Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning (depth-limited)
* AI evaluation function (basic heuristic with room for improvement)
* Win detection and valid move checking

---

## 🧠 AI Highlights

* **Minimax**: Simulates game states to select the best move
* **Alpha-Beta Pruning**: Skips unpromising branches for faster decisions
* **Heuristic**: Currently random, can be upgraded for more competitive AI
